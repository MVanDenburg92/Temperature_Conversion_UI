# Temperature_Conversion_UI

Created a function called feelTemp, that converts a given temperature (in Fahrenheit) into four categorical levels, hot, warm, cool,
and cold using the following criteria: 

    if the temperature is 100 or above, the functions returns “It is hot.”;
    if the temperature is between 70 and 100, the function returns “It is warm.”;
    if the temperature is between 32 and 70, the functions returns “It is cool.”;
    if the temperature is below 32, it returns “It is cold.”

The function feelTemp will take one value for the temperature, and then returns a category as a string.

When running the program, the user is prompted to input a temperature.
The program  then prints one of the four categorical levels (hot, warm, cool, and cold) that the given temperature falls into.
